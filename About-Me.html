            <h2>Returning Programmer</h2>
            <p>Having been out of work for a protacted period of time, I am eagerly looking to get back in to tech industry</p>
            <p>
                I Graduated from Nottingham Trent University with a Computer Science degree in 2013 and The University of East Anglia with a Masters Degree in Advanced Computing Science in 2014.
            </p>
            <p> I am currently working through a web development focused course in order to prepare myself for regular work. This also gives me a chance to better understand front-end development, since in the past I have been principally focused on back-end development</p>
